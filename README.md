# CPAN Gamification

The barrier to entry for CPAN is intentionally set very low:
you can create a very minimal module and upload a tarball containing it
to CPAN.

But there are many more things that a well-behaved distribution can
do, to make life easy for the toolchain, search engines and Perl
programmers.

These notes describe thoughts about to use gamification ideas to
encourage module authors to follow the modern conventions for
CPAN distributions.

## Background

These notes are based on a discussion held at the QA Hackathon 2014
